### OpenCoder Engine Go

OpenCoder Engine is the backend for an online compiler. The engine accepts code as input, compiles it and executes it. This is done in the pipeline, which chooses the appropriate compiler - runner pair and gives the location of the output. This can be run inside a docker container for isolation.
